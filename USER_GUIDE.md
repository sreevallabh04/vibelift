## Tips & Tricks

### 🎯 Accuracy Tips

**For Food Tracking:**
- Be specific with portions: "200g chicken breast" vs "chicken"
- Include cooking methods: "grilled", "fried", "baked"
- List all ingredients in mixed dishes
- The AI learns from context, so more detail = better accuracy

**For Weight Tracking:**
- Weigh yourself at the same time each day (morning is best)
- Use the same scale consistently
- Track trends, not daily fluctuations
- Weekly averages are more meaningful than daily changes

**For Lifting:**
- Log sets immediately after completing them
- Be honest with your weight and reps
- Track failed sets too (they're data!)
- Notes help remember what worked

### 🚀 Productivity Hacks

1. **Favorites**: Mark frequently eaten meals as favorites for one-tap logging
2. **Swipe to Delete**: Quick cleanup of incorrect entries
3. **Pull to Refresh**: Update dashboard after logging data elsewhere
4. **Dark Mode**: Easier on eyes during evening/night workouts

- Every Monday, review your dashboard
- Compare weight trend from last week
