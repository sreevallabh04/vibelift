### 3. **Health Connect Screen** (`lib/screens/health_connect/health_connect_screen.dart`)
Beautiful onboarding UI for connecting to health apps:

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
Added health data cards to the dashboard:

### 5. **Android Manifest Configuration**
Properly configured permissions for:

## How It Works

### Connection Flow:
```

2. Navigate to Health Connect screen
3. Request permissions from Samsung Health/Health Connect
4. User grants permissions
5. Data syncs automatically
6. Dashboard shows real health data
```
