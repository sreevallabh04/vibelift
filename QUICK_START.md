# VibeLift Quick Start Guide âš¡

Get VibeLift running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites Check

```bash
flutter doctor
```

Make sure you have:
- âœ… Flutter SDK (3.0.0+)
- âœ… Android Studio or VS Code
- âœ… At least one target platform ready (Android/iOS/Web/Desktop)

## One-Time Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**Expected output**: "Got dependencies!" âœ…

### Step 2: Generate Database Code

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

**Expected output**: "Built with build_runner/aot" âœ…  
**Result**: Creates `lib/data/db/database.g.dart`

### Step 3: Create Platform Files (If Needed)

#### For Android
```bash
flutter create --platforms android .
```

#### For iOS
```bash
flutter create --platforms ios .
```

#### For Web
```bash
flutter create --platforms web .
```

#### For Windows
```bash
flutter create --platforms windows .
```

#### For macOS
```bash
flutter create --platforms macos .
```

#### For Linux
```bash
flutter create --platforms linux .
```

#### For All Platforms (Recommended)
```bash
flutter create --platforms android,ios,web,windows,macos,linux .
```

**Note**: This adds platform-specific folders (android/, ios/, web/, etc.) without overwriting your lib/ code.

## Running the App

### Quick Run (Default Device)
```bash
flutter run
```

### Run on Specific Device

**Check available devices:**
```bash
flutter devices
```

**Run on specific device:**
```bash

flutter run -d windows       # Windows desktop
flutter run -d edge          # Web in Edge
flutter run -d emulator-5554 # Android emulator
```

### Development Mode (Hot Reload)
```bash
flutter run
# Then press 'r' for hot reload, 'R' for hot restart
```

### Release Build
```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# iOS IPA (requires Mac)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release

# Windows
flutter build windows --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "database.g.dart not found"
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Issue: API error when analyzing meals
The Gemini API key is included. If it fails:
- Check internet connection
- Wait a moment and retry
- The app will use default values if API fails

### Issue: No platform files
```bash
flutter create --platforms <platform-name> .
```

### Issue: Build errors
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

### Issue: Hot reload not working
Press **R** (capital) for full restart instead of **r**.

## Useful Commands

### Development
```bash
flutter run                    # Run app
flutter clean                  # Clean build cache
flutter pub get               # Install dependencies
flutter doctor                # Check setup
flutter analyze               # Check code quality
```

### Building
```bash
flutter build apk             # Android release
flutter build web             # Web release
flutter build windows         # Windows release
```

### Debugging
```bash
flutter run -v                # Verbose output
flutter logs                  # View logs
flutter devices               # List devices
flutter emulators             # List emulators
```

## Performance Tips

### For Best Performance:
1. **Use Release mode** for actual usage: `flutter run --release`
2. **Profile mode** for debugging performance: `flutter run --profile`
3. **Debug mode** for development: `flutter run` (default)

### Difference:
- **Debug**: Slow, but has hot reload
- **Profile**: Fast, with performance tools
- **Release**: Fastest, optimized for users

## Advanced: Custom Fonts (Optional)

To use the Poppins font:

1. Download from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)
2. Place these in `assets/fonts/`:
   - Poppins-Regular.ttf
   - Poppins-Medium.ttf
   - Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
   - Poppins-Bold.ttf

3. In `pubspec.yaml`, uncomment:
```yaml
fonts:
  - family: Poppins
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
      # ... etc
```

4. In `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`, uncomment all:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
